# #100DaysOfCode Journey

A repository where I will log my activities for the next 100 days as part of my #100DaysOfCode Journey

## Day 1: Git and Github Crash course

Today I learned about Git and Github which are very essential code versioning tools.
I learned and have managed to use some of the most used commands such checking the status, adding, cloning, forking, pushing and undoing changes from the local repository to the remote github repository

## Day 2: Flexbox Crash Course

Today I learned about how to effectively position elements using CSS Flexbox. As a practice, I also created a fictional company called "Dream Cruises" in which I used flexbox solely to position the elements in this page. I have also uploaded this project to my Github page

## Day 3: CSS Grid Crash Course

On Day 3, I took some crash couse on FreeCodecamp's youtube page about CSS Grid. Here i learned about an efficient way on positioning my elements. I was blown away in particular to the grid-template-areas feature as I found it quite easy and convenient to implement when positioning elements in a website

## Day 4: Paws Center Website

On Day 4, I started working on another fictional company called Paws Center. Here I used the knowledge I learned about positioning elements using CSS Grid and started layouting the website as well as finding the theme/colors 

## Day 5: Paws Center Website - continuation. Sass Crash course start

On Day 5, I have managed to complete the Paws Center website, and uploaded it to my repository in Github. I also started watching another crash course using Sass from Brad Traversy's youtube channel

## Day 6: Sass Crash Course completion and another website

On Day 6, I have managed to complete the Sass crash course training. I was impressed with how neat and organized my css codes looked like especially when writing it in a sass file.
I didn't managed to learn all the commands but it gave me a foundation to use at least the basic and mostly used commands/syntax. I have also finished another single page website styling it using Sass.

## Day 7: JavaScript Crash course

On Day 7, I started taking JavaScript crash course and built mini projects along with it. Most of the projects created were based on the mini projects from Coding Addict.
