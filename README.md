# #100DaysOfCode Journey

A repository where I will log my activities for the next 100 days as part of my #100DaysOfCode Journey

## Day 1: Git and Github Crash course

Today I learned about Git and Github which are very essential code versioning tools.
I learned and have managed to use some of the most used commands such checking the status, adding, cloning, forking, pushing and undoing changes from the local repository to the remote github repository

Tomorrow, I will tackle the CSS box model including the popular layouting features of Flexbox and CSS Grid
